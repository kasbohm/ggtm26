# Copilot Instructions for Gåpings Mallorca Codebase

## Overview
This project is designed to facilitate route planning for a cycling trip in Mallorca, utilizing GPX files to manage routes and display them on a map. The application is structured to support both elite and recreational cyclists, allowing users to select and customize their routes.

## Architecture
- **Main Components**: The application consists of HTML files for structure (`index.html`, `mobile.html`) and CSS for styling embedded within the HTML files.
- **Data Flow**: Routes are loaded from GPX files located in the `routes/` directory. The application processes these files to generate route options for users.
- **Service Boundaries**: The main service boundaries are defined by the user interface (UI) components in `index.html` and `mobile.html`.

## Developer Workflows
- **Building and Running**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application. Ensure that all GPX files are present in the `routes/` directory.
- **Testing**: There are no formal tests defined in this codebase. Manual testing is required to ensure functionality.
- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and debug JavaScript. Console logs are used for error reporting and debugging.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **File Naming**: GPX files follow a specific naming convention: `GGTM26_D{dayNum}_{type}_{description}.gpx`. The `{type}` can be `A` for elite routes and `B` for recreational routes.
- **JavaScript Functions**: Key functions include `autoMakeElite()` and `autoMakeMosjonist()`, which automate route selection based on user preferences.

## Integration Points
- **External Dependencies**: The project uses Leaflet.js for map rendering, included via CDN in the HTML files. Ensure internet access for proper functionality.
- **Cross-Component Communication**: The UI components communicate with the JavaScript logic through event handlers defined in the HTML files, such as `onclick` for buttons and `onchange` for checkboxes.

## Key Files and Directories
- **HTML Files**: 
  - `index.html`: Main entry point for desktop users.
  - `mobile.html`: Entry point for mobile users, redirects from `index.html` based on user agent.

- **Routes Directory**: 
  - `routes/`: Contains all GPX files used by the application.
